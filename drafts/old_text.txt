We modeled the potential interaction between Dungeness crab fishing gear and humpback whales using two humpback whale distribution models (Figure S4): (1) a summer/fall model (Jul-Dec) that spans the entire California coast (Becker et al. 2016) and (2) a winter/spring model (Jan-Apr) that covers southern California (Becker et al. 2017). This approach required two assumptions: (1) that whales are not present in northern California during the winter and spring and (2) that May and June distributions, which are not represented in either model, can be approximated using the summer/fall model. Both models use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to   (Table S2; Figure S5). We used the models to hindcast humpback whale densities over the simulation period (March 2, 2014 to July 1, 2019) using dynamic ocean variables from the ROMS California Current System Near Real-Time Analysis from the UC Santa Cruz Ocean Modeling and Data Assimilation group (Moore et al. 2011) and bathymetric variables from the ETOPOI 1 arc-minute global-relief model (Amante and Eakins 2009). The ROMS ocean variables are available on a 0.1Â° grid (~10 km resolution) and 8-day running averages centered on the prediction day were used as predictors in both models.
